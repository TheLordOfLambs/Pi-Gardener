# Pi-Gardener
Automates the maintenance of a plant with a raspberry-pi

First we'll need :
  - Raspberry Pi (with raspbian)
  - Arduino nano
  - 12V-DC Pump
  - Soil moisture sensor
 
Optional :
  - Temperature sensor
  - Air humidity sensor
  - Light sensor (or just a photoresistor)
  - All sensor you want to add
  


The Pi will be in charge of all the logic and the Arduino will handle electronics

The main code will be in python 3
